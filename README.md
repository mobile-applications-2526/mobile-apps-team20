## 🎯 What is CampusConnect?

Moments helps students feel more connected to their campus and city life.

Users can explore activities happening nearby, host their own events, and join others with just a tap. When a user joins an event, they are automatically added to a group chat with other participants, making it easy to connect, plan, and break the ice before meeting in person.
